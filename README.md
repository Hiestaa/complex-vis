# complex-vis

Fun with complex numbers (yeah, I mean it!)

This is a simple experiment of iterating `Z[n+1] = z[n] * X[n] + c`, where `Z[0]` is represented by the marker A, and `c` is represented by the marker B.

## Run

Simply open the `complex.html` page in the browser and try to move around the A and B markers.

The background represents the number of possible iterations for every possible position of the Variable Marker given the current position of the other marker.

This results in the Julia Set fractal, when using the Variable Marker A:

And the Mandelbrot Set fractal, when using the Variable Marker B:
